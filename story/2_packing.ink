{
    - supernatural <= -2:
        You spend a large portion of the evening researching the shrine's history online, focusing on old newspaper articles and academic papers about its cultural significance.
        While skeptical of supernatural claims, you're intrigued by the documented architectural details and historical ceremonies.
        The logical part of your mind suggests there must be rational explanations behind the legends - perhaps clever engineering or natural phenomena.
    - supernatural >= 2:
        As night approaches, you find yourself drawn into research about ancient Shinto practices and sacred sites.
        The stories about the "Kagura Yume" ritual and its connection to the shrine fill you with a mix of excitement and reverence.
        Each account of supernatural encounters sends a peculiar thrill through you - equal parts fear and fascination.
    - else:
        You spend the evening doing general research about the shrine, trying to separate fact from fiction.
        While the supernatural stories are intriguing, you're more interested in understanding its historical significance.

{curiosity >= 2:
    The shrine's mysteries consume your thoughts. You sketch rough maps based on old photographs, marking points of interest.

In your research, you discover there are two possible routes to the shrine - the longer beach path that follows the coastline, or an old maintenance path that winds up through the mountain.

The mountain route seems more direct but potentially treacherous, while the beach path is well-documented but takes considerably longer.

    @Airi: I've got spares! We can share!
    Their enthusiasm is contagious, making even the daunting aspects of tomorrow feel more like an exciting shared adventure.
